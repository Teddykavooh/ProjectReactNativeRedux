# ProjectReactNativeRedux
* This is a simple project to guide with `Redux State-Management` in `React-Native`.
* **NOTE:** Project is also `expo-based`.

## Project Init
- Redux `Redux-Toolkit aka Modern Redux`
- To initialise the project:

  1. Make sure Node.js is installed. `node -v`
  2. Make sure npm is installed as well. `npm -v`
  3. Install expo globally just to be sure: `npm install --global expo-cli` - **DEPRECIATED**
  4. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
  5. Start project: `npx expo start`

- If at some point you run into this error:

  > Some dependencies are incompatible with the installed expo package version:
  >
  > - The fix is: `npx expo install --fix`

  - The above error could result from differing versions to `expo`.
